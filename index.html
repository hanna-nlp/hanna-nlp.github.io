      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a computer scientist specializing in generative AI and natural language processing (NLP). Motivated by real-world impact, my work focuses on simple, effective solutions to complex AI problems. <br> <br>
        My team develops open-science AI solutions, spanning data generation, novel algorithms, and open-source models. I believe that while models may come and go, robust solutions endure—this is why I advocate for an open-science approach. <br><br>
        I co-lead the open language model and reasoning projects OLMo and Tulu, demonstrating that with the right approach, it is possible to build state-of-the-art models that rival proprietary systems—while remaining transparent, open, and scientifically grounded. <br><br>
         Some other notable widely-adopted projects from my team include: RLVR, self-RAG, self-instruct, and open scholar. </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      My team’s work is recognized for:
      <ul>
        <li>Pioneering research on large language and reasoning models through novel methods and data technologies that make these systems more powerful, efficient, and effective. </li>
        <li>Open AI initiatives such as OLMo and Tulu—among the first truly open models—providing state-of-the-art systems, datasets, training resources, and tools to the public, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and accessibility. </li>
        <li>The science of AI and evaluation, systematically examining the capabilities, limitations, and behavior of AI systems to better understand how large models learn, reason, and make decisions. </li>
        <li>AI for science, creating systems that interpret scientific text and data, with a focus on integrating tools and intelligent agents to accelerate discovery. </li>li>
      </ul>
